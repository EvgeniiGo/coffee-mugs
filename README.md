# Coffee-mugs

[**Coffee-mugs**](https://evgeniigo.github.io/coffee-mugs/) is an online shop's website which offers a wide range of products and includes personal blogs from the site's team members on related topics.

## About the Project

The project built as a part of my self-studies to practice **TypeScript** and **React** with **Vite** tool.  
It is based on the free [Coffee Shop Website Template](https://webflow.com/templates/html/coffeestyle-business-website-template) from webflow with some minor improvements.

It has 5 unique pages:

1. [Main](https://evgeniigo.github.io/coffee-mugs/) - main page of the website.
2. [Products](https://evgeniigo.github.io/coffee-mugs/products) - shows available products for purchase and offers an option to filter them by category
3. [Blog](https://evgeniigo.github.io/coffee-mugs/blog) - shows blog posts for reading and offers an option to filter them by author and category
4. [About](https://evgeniigo.github.io/coffee-mugs/about) - tells the story of the shop and introduces it's team.
